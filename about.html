                  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                  <p>A full stack Javascript web developer with an aptitude for design. It was a only a few shorts years ago where I stumbled across the fascinating world of web development and decided to learn everything I could about it. 
                  Ever since I wrote my first line of code and saw it come to life on a browser, I thought to myself, this could be it. Is this what I was meant to do?
                  I found it so fascinating to me, that in today's world we are surrounded by all sorts of technology, from mobile applications to artificial intelligence. And boy, did that peak my interest.
                  I knew there would be a steep learning curve as a developer, and that is one of many reasons why I decided to learn all there is necessary in order to become a developer. The journey is just beginning...</p>
                  <h3>Some other things about me... </h3>
                  <p>When I am away from my computer (once I have stepped out in the "real" world), I am very active.
                  I love going on adventures with friends, getting lost, living a very healthy lifestyle by going to the gym five to six days a week. 
                  I have recently fell in love with film and photography, I am learning quite a bit about DSLR cameras and filmmaking. Oh, and I occasionally do some modelling =)</p>
